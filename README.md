ds_dup = ds.duplicated()
ds_dup
```

![alt text](<Screenshot 2025-01-30 150629.png>)

#### Cleaning Data:
Dropped some unimportant columns:

```Python
ds.drop(['Doors', 'Seats', 'ColourExtInt'],axis=1,inplace=True)
```

Dropped null values of 2 columns and renamed values in the BodyType columm.
"HiAce" ‚Üí "Hiace"
, "Ute / Trays" ‚Üí "UTE"
, "Commercial" ‚Üí "Van"
, "Land" ‚Üí "Land Rover"


```Python
# Ensure no NaN values in 'Model' and 'Title' columns
ds['Model'] = ds['Model'].fillna('')
ds['Title'] = ds['Title'].fillna('')

# Update 'BodyType' for models starting with "HiAce"
ds.loc[ds['Model'].str.startswith("HIACE"), "BodyType"] = "Van"

# Standardize 'HiAce' to 'Hiace' in the 'Model' and 'Title' columns
ds['Model'] = ds['Model'].str.replace('HiAce', 'Hiace', regex=False)
ds['Title'] = ds['Title'].str.replace('HiAce', 'Hiace', regex=False)

# Verify changes
changed_ds = ds[ds['Model'].str.contains("Hiace")]
changed_ds2 = ds[ds['Title'].str.contains("Hiace")]

changed_ds
```
![alt text](<Screenshot 2025-01-30 160200.png>)

```Python
#Change data values "Commercial", "Van" in "BodyType" column

ds.loc[ds['BodyType'] == "Commercial", "BodyType"] = "Van"

ds[ds['BodyType'] == "Van"].head()
```
![alt text](<Screenshot 2025-01-30 160320.png>)

```Python
ds.loc[ds['BodyType'] == "Ute / Tray", "BodyType"] = "UTE"
```

```Python
# Changing Brand name "Land Rover"

ds.loc[ds['Brand'] == "Land", "Brand"] = "Land Rover"

ds[ds['Brand'] == "Land Rover"].head()
```
Replaced inconsistent name of "Land Rover" model with correct name based on Title

```Python
def categorized_title(title, brand):
    # Return the original title for non-Land Rover cars
    if brand != "Land Rover":  
        return title

    # Check for missing values
    if pd.isna(title):  
        return "Not Found"
        
    # Convert to string to handle non-string values
    title = str(title)  
    if "Evoque" in title:
        return "Evoque"
    elif "Discovery" in title:
        return "Discovery"
    elif "HSE" in title:
        return "HSE"
    elif "Vogue" in title:
        return "Vogue"
    elif "Velar" in title:
        return "Velar"
    elif "Autobiography" in title:
        return "Autobiography"
    elif "Sport" in title:
        return "Sport"
    elif "P530" in title:
        return "P530"
    elif "Defender" in title:
        return "Defender"
    elif "Freelander" in title:
        return "Freelander"
    elif "P525" in title:
        return "P525"
    elif "D300" in title:
        return "D300"
    elif "D350" in title:
        return "D350"
    else:
        return "Not Found"

# Apply the function
ds['Model'] = ds.apply(lambda row: categorized_title(row['Title'], row['Brand']), axis=1)

ds[ds['Brand'] == "Land Rover"].head()
```
![alt text](<Screenshot 2025-01-30 161229.png>)

Added one column named "State" to conveniently visualize the location 

```Python
# Check if 'Location' exists in the DataFrame
if 'Location' in ds.columns:
    # Extract the last 3 characters from the 'Location' column and assign to 'States'
    ds['States'] = ds['Location'].str[-3:]
else:
    print("Column 'Location' does not exist.")

if 'Location' in ds.columns:
    # Extract the last 3 characters
    states_values = ds['Location'].str[-3:]
    
    # Get the position of 'Location'
    location_index = ds.columns.get_loc('Location')
    
    # Insert 'States' next to 'Location'
    if 'States' in ds.columns:
        ds.drop(columns=['States'], inplace=True)
    ds.insert(location_index + 1, 'States', states_values)
else:
    print("Column 'Location' does not exist.")
```

"Other" ‚Üí Assigned appropriate values based on vehicle Model and Title.
```Python
ds.loc[ds['BodyType'] == "Other", "BodyType"] = ""

ds[ds['BodyType'] == "Other"]
```
Filled missing values in the BodyType column based on relevant attributes like Model and Title.
```Python
# Keywords for each body type

#### *The relationship between Price and other factors such as Kilometres and Fuel Consumption*

![alt text](<Dashboard 9.png>)

Price vs Kilometres:

- The plot shows a negative correlation between price and kilometres driven. As the kilometres increase, the price drops significantly, reflecting depreciation with usage.

- High-priced cars with lower kilometres dominate the dataset, while heavily used cars show prices under $100,000 regardless of brand or type.

Price vs Fuel Consumption:

- This plot suggests a slight positive trend between price and fuel consumption. Luxury cars with high engine performance (often consuming more fuel) tend to have higher prices.

- Lower-priced vehicles generally fall in the low-to-medium fuel consumption range, reinforcing the affordability of fuel-efficient models.
